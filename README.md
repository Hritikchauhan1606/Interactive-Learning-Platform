# Interactive-Learning-Platform
FYND-Academy Final Project

Description - 
During classes , we record live sessions which are approx 4-5 hrs long videos, which makes it really difficult to search for a particular topic if we want to see from the past ones. So , my idea is a platform with topic wise content along with quizzes and small exercises with every topic . And a point and ranking system with quiz, such as , if a student correctly does a quiz, he'll be rewarded 1 star for each correct answer given, and accordingly will be given a rank which will be shown publicly to all the students. This will make learning competitive and fun.
There will be two roles in the platform, student and teacher. The student can login using their credentials and on the dashboard, they can see their accumulated stars and their ranking among other students. The teachers can login and add more content and quizzes.
